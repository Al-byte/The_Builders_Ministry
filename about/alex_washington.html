            <p class="text-left">I’ve always believed that life is a journey made meaningful through growth, connection, and purpose. My story weaves together a love for teaching, entrepreneurship, technology, ministry, and family—all grounded in faith and a desire to serve others.</p>
            <p class="text-left">My professional path has been diverse, each step shaping me in unique ways. I began my career teaching elementary Physical Education from 2015 to 2017. During this time, I learned the value of patience, structure, and the joy of investing in young lives. In 2017, I took a bold step into entrepreneurship and opened my own escape room business. I managed operations, crafted immersive puzzle experiences, and discovered a passion for creating spaces that brought people together through creativity and problem-solving. During this time, I ventured into the tech world and became a web developer, combining logic with design to build practical and user-friendly solutions. This phase of my career sparked an interest in business strategy and finance, which led me back to school. In 2023, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a major in Finance. Shortly afterward, I accepted a position with the Bank of New York, where I continue to develop professionally while contributing to a team that values excellence, integrity, and innovation.</p>
            <p class="text-left">In January 2025, I married Anneliese, the love of my life and my greatest encourager. Our marriage is built on faith, friendship, and mutual support. Together, we’re building a home rooted in joy, grace, and shared purpose. Every day with her is a gift, and I’m grateful to walk through life side by side.</p>
            <p class="text-left">In my downtime, I gravitate toward the things that bring a sense of fun and adventure. I’m a big fan of movies and TV shows, often drawn to storytelling that sparks the imagination or invites reflection. I also enjoy theme parks and escape rooms—spaces that combine creativity, excitement, and community. Video games are another favorite pastime, offering a chance to unwind and explore new worlds. These hobbies not only entertain but also serve as a reminder of the importance of play, curiosity, and rest.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Each chapter of my life—from the gym floor to the escape room, from code to finance—has taught me something new about myself and about God's purpose for me. I’m passionate about growing, giving, and living with intention. Whether formally involved in church activities or serving behind the scenes, my heart has always been committed to encouraging and supporting others in their walk with Christ. While I don’t hold a formal ministry title, my life and work are deeply shaped by a call to live faithfully, love generously, and reflect Christ in everyday interactions. In my career, my marriage, or the small moments in life, my aim is to remain faithful to God, trusting Him to guide my path.</p>
