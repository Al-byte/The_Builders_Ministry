            <h1 class="mb-5">Greg Bennett</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12 card py-4">
            <p class="text-left">Married to his beloved wife Joan for over 40 years, Greg is a devoted husband, father of four (Jessiah, Nathan, Erin, and Meghan), and a proud grandfather to four—so far. He also cherishes his relationships with son-in-law Taylor, daughter-in-law Amanda, and soon-to-be son-in-law Andy, who will marry Meghan this fall. Whether hiking, fishing, camping, birdwatching, or joining the occasional 5K, he finds joy and renewal in God’s creation.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Professionally and spiritually, Greg has spent his life building both businesses and people. He earned his BS in Business Administration with a focus in Finance from the University of Arizona and went on to complete his MBA at Keller Graduate School of Business in Milwaukee. After ten years as Vice President and General Manager at TSR Solutions Inc., he founded Wisconsin Strategic Web Marketing LLC, which he successfully led as owner for many years.</p>
            <p class="text-left">In addition to his business credentials, Greg holds a Master of Arts in Ministry (Cum Laude) from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and a Certificate in Biblical Studies from Moody Bible Institute. He is a licensed and ordained chaplain through the International Fellowship of Chaplains (since October 2029), combining academic depth with pastoral compassion.</p>
            <p class="text-left">He currently serves as the Board President of FaithWalkers Men’s Ministry, an interdenominational men’s fellowship in Milwaukee. When its future was uncertain, Greg stepped in to provide leadership and stability. Under his guidance, the group has grown both in number and in spiritual maturity. He teaches, mentors leaders, maintains the ministry website, and works alongside a six-man teaching team to disciple men from a wide range of churches and backgrounds.</p>
            <p class="text-left">His longstanding involvement at Eastbrook Church, a vibrant congregation of over 1,000 members, spans more than two decades. He has served as an elder, Church Council President, teacher, and small group leader. As part of the Spiritual Formation Institute, he has taught Bible, theology, and foundational Christian principles, helping integrate hundreds of new believers into the life of the church. Together with Joan, he also serves as a marriage mentor, walking alongside couples as they prepare to build Christ-centered marriages.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Other ministry roles have included:</p>
            <ul class="text-left">
              <li>Teaching and preaching in local churches and community outreach events</li>
              <li>Seminar speaker at retreats and youth events</li>
              <li>High school wilderness trip leader and Pioneer Boys mentor</li>
              <li>Alpha Ministries participant</li>
              <li>Writer and presenter of a 10-week seminar on Christian forgiveness</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-left">His parachurch involvement includes board leadership with Acacia Theatre (a Christian company based in Milwaukee), a decade of service as a leader and speaker for the Milwaukee Downtown Astor Hotel Men’s Fellowship, preaching at Heart-Fire Ministries for Milwaukee’s homeless, and guest speaking for InterVarsity large group events.</p>
            <p class="text-left">With a heart for discipleship, a gift for teaching, and a lifetime of experience in leadership, Greg remains dedicated to helping individuals grow in Christ, thrive in community, and live lives rooted in purpose.</p>
