            <p class="text-left">A.O. Smith, located in Milwaukee, hired me as a Tool and Die Maker Apprentice. It is also where my education and employment continued. Eventually, I was promoted to Director of Advance Manufacturing managing $1.5B in future lower vehicle structure launches. Prior to retirement, I consulted for several years, including two years in Barcelona, Spain supervising the development, design and launch for Europe’s first pickup truck.</p>
            <p class="text-left">As young parents, my wife and I enjoyed our roles as Youth Group Pastors for seven years at Eastbrook Church.  Fuller Seminary equipped me with techniques to help ministry leaders wishing to enhance their communities, with a focus on small group development.  I also had the privilege of serving on the Eastbrook Church council for seven years with Dr. Marc Erickson, and as Council President for three terms of those years.</p>
            <p class="text-left">My wife, Rita, who was my childhood sweetheart, and I will celebrate our 50 year anniversary in August 2025. We enjoy life in Rhode Island with two sweet little pups and six chickens that we inherited with our new home!  We are blessed that our two wonderful adult children, our beloved son-in-law, and two amazing grandchildren also reside in the country’s smallest state.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Retirement allows me more time to enjoy hobbies which include golfing, gardening, studying and teaching God’s Word, deep sea fishing, and fellowshipping with family and friends.</p>
