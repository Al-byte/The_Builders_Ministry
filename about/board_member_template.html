            <p class="text-left">My biography, plain and simple, reflects a life of faith, opportunity and adventure. My faith in God has provided great opportunities in my Christian church life and for God-led exciting experiences. I was born in Neptune, New Jersey where I attended high school. I had two major goals. First was to learn computer technology. Second was to excel in sports; I lettered in soccer, wrestling and gymnastics. From a young child my family consistently attended the local Baptist church. Fond memories are of dressing up for church, emotional worship and powerful preaching.</p>
            <p class="text-left">But it wasn’t until college before I truly met Jesus. My loving mother, who worked three jobs, encouraged and supported me to attend Milwaukee School of Engineering. Although the study was difficult, my scholastic rewards included three earned degrees - (Associate degrees in Computer Engineering and Data Communication, and a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Management). But the greatest reward was the time I spent with the Navigators and Campus Crusade organizations. These christian believers loved and accepted me. In 1970 at one of their retreats I could not help but totally give my life to Christ. Right after this conversion the real adventure began.</p>
            <p class="text-left">There was an opportunity to move out of the dorms and live in the attic of the home belonging to Dr. and Mrs. Marc Erickson. They were a missionary family, with five children, who spent years in Africa. Life with them was filled with prayer, bible study and church. My faith grew and I adopted a love for missions. Pastor Marc, who was an emergency doctor, was asked to start a new church on the east side of Milwaukee. It was a privilege to tag along with him and his family to experience God’s will for what became a huge blessing.</p>
            <p class="text-left">One Sunday I sat in the back of church so that I could observe the congregation and fully take in the worship and preaching. On the worship team that Sunday was a young lady who sang a solo. With the first few notes of her song my eyes teared up. The power of the Holy Spirit on this singer was so strong you could hear a pin drop between the weeping sound of many attendees. And even today I am brought to tears when this beautiful lady sings; who is now my wife.  Her name - Helene Marie Pickett. She has taught me so much how to love and serve the Lord that she is indeed a significant part of my life.</p>
            <p class="text-left">To ensure that my Christian beliefs and commitment was sound I also attended multiple Christian schools. For integration studies I attended Regent College in Vancouver, Canada for a year. I then attended Fuller seminary for two years. Most recently I will be graduating from Midwest Bible College with a bachelor’s degree in the Holy Bible in May of 2025. My service duties include singing in our church choir where we have also provided worship at the Milwaukee Rescue Mission. I am also a member of our church mobile choir where a small ensemble of singers will go to hospitals, retirement facilities and personal homes to offer worship and communion to those who are unable to attend church including the terminally ill. I was also honored to teach Sunday classes to grade school kids, to church seniors, and a class for grieving youths who experienced death in their family with friends.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Professionally my career is largely involved with project management. I have certifications from the PMI Institute in both project and risk management. I have worked on projects in the USA, Canada, Mexico, South America, Australia, China, Japan, Europe, India, Indonesia and Israel. Most recent work was with Rockwell Automation where I spent 10 years and worked mostly in mergers and acquisitions. I am also a member of Toastmasters International where I held local positions as President, Vice President (Membership and Public Relations).</p>
            <p class="text-left">My prayer is that God will continue to use me in any way, at any time and at any place He calls me to go.</p>
