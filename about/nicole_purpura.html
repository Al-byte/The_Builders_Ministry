            <p class="text-left">With an unwavering commitment to the spiritual, intellectual, and personal development of others, Dr. Nicole Purpura has dedicated over three decades to empowering individuals and strengthening institutions through education, ministry, and strategic leadership. As a bilingual educator, college president, author, and ordained minister, Dr. Nicole Purpura exemplifies servant leadership through the integration of faith, scholarship, and service.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Dr. Nicole Purpura currently serves as President of Midwest Bible College in West Allis, Wisconsin, a position she assumed in 2024 after 20 years as Lead Instructor and member of the Board of Directors. Her leadership at the College reflects a deep vision for continuing on the legacy that her father, Dr. R.L. Bowen, began over 20 years ago.  She has championed increased student enrollment, international outreach (both online and in person) in Africa, satellite learning opportunities, and deeper engagement with training students to be servant leaders. At the heart of her work lies a passion to prepare students to learn the Word of God and to change their world through education and leadership.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Since 2003, Dr. Purpura has been instrumental in shaping the curriculum and academic direction of Midwest Bible College, teaching Associate, Bachelor, Master’s and Doctoral-level courses. Her influence extends across inter-academic programs and multi-church collaborations involving more than 40 ministries.</p>
            <p class="text-left">From 2013 to 2024, Dr. Purpura taught Spanish language classes at Heritage Christian Schools in New Berlin, Wisconsin, where she managed five levels of language instruction, teaching an average of 130 students daily. In addition to classroom instruction, she sponsored the Student Government, led Leadership and Introduction to Business classes, and actively served on the school’s Diversity and Chapel Committees. Her innovative curriculum design and dedication to student leadership development left a lasting impact on the school community.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Before her tenure in education, Dr. Purpura served for over 15 years in full-time ministry at New Song Church in Greenfield, Wisconsin. As the Worship Pastor, she oversaw the music ministry of multiple weekly services, led diverse ministry teams, and pioneered 12 bilingual, multicultural volunteer programs aimed at holistic congregational well-being and leadership training. Her administrative and worship leadership helped unite the congregation and helped deepen cultural sensitivity, spiritual unity, and organizational development.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Dr. Purpura’s early professional career spans various leadership roles in international sales, marketing, and operations. Her positions with Deltrol Precision, The Frantz Group, and Manpower International Headquarters showcase her business acumen, particularly in Spanish-language communication, cross-cultural sales, and corporate training. These experiences laid the groundwork for her later work, bridging ministry and marketplace leadership. She also held roles with Can-Am Financial Corporation, Merrick & Company, and as a Translation Assistant for Manpower Temporary Services, further refining her communication and organizational skills in international contexts.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Academically, Dr. Purpura holds a Doctorate in Biblical Studies with an emphasis in Worship from Midwest Bible College, a Master of Arts in Education from Wisconsin Lutheran College, and a Master of Arts in Sacred Music from the North Carolina School of Theology. Her academic journey began at Oral Roberts University, where she graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish and International Business, complemented by immersive language study at the University Language Institute in Valencia, Spain.</p>
            <p class="text-left">In 2021, Dr. Purpura authored The Wonder of Worship, published by Covenant Books, offering readers a heartfelt and scholarly exploration of worship as a transformative encounter with God. Her writing echoes the themes of her life's work—spiritual formation through worship, cultural understanding, and journeying into worship to fulfill one’s divine purpose.</p>
            <p class="text-left">A leader marked by excellence, empathy, and vision, Dr. Purpura continues to inspire students, colleagues, and communities alike through her multifaceted service and unwavering faith.</p>
