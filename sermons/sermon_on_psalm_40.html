            <h4 class="written_section_heading">Introduction</h4>
            <p>It is both a joy and an honor to come before you today, representing Milwaukee Bible College (MBC) — the very place that ordained me and where I now serve as the Chairman of the Board. MBC is not just a school — it’s a movement. It's a unique Bible college, laser-focused on teaching the unfiltered, uncompromising Word of God. Our mission is simple: to prepare men and women of all ages, races, and backgrounds to serve in ministry. But hear me clearly — this is not just for pastors. It’s for anyone hungry to know the Word of God and carry the gospel into their communities, our city, our state, and the world.</p>
            <p>Each year, our student body includes representatives from around 40 different churches. And the reach doesn’t stop there. Since 2018, we’ve partnered with MBC Uganda, training pastors across eight African nations. In just 25 years, our students have planted over 500 churches across the globe. To God be the glory.</p>
            <h4 class="written_section_heading">Psalm 40: A Song of Deliverance and Thanksgiving</h4>
            <p>Let’s turn now to Psalm 40 — a deeply personal and powerful psalm of deliverance, gratitude, and transformation.</p>
            <p class="written_scripture">"I waited patiently for the Lord; he turned to me and heard my cry." (Psalm 40:1)</p>
            <p>Let me pause right there and ask — Have you ever wondered if God really hears your cry? I did. For 56 years, I cried out to God from the depths of depression. Like the psalmist in Psalm 69, I felt as though I was sinking in a pit of despair:</p>
            <p class="written_scripture">“I have come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me. I am weary with my crying out; my throat is parched.” (Psalm 69:2-3)</p>
            <p>I pleaded like David:</p>
            <p class="written_scripture">“Deliver me from the mire!” (Psalm 69:14)</p>
            <p>My depression was like being trapped in a slimy pit, dragging me through guilt, shame, condemnation, anger, fear, and hopelessness. It was a prison of the mind — a torment filled with Satan’s accusations and my own self-condemnation. But then… God heard my cry. He didn’t just lift me — He healed me. After 53 long years, God completely delivered me. I’ve been walking in freedom for almost three years now. No more depression. Just joy.</p>
            <p class="written_scripture">“He set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.” (Psalm 40:2)</p>
            <p>He placed me on the unshakable rock — Christ Jesus, my Redeemer and Friend. And now?</p>
            <p class="written_scripture">“He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God.” (Psalm 40:3)</p>
            <p>My heart overflows with praise, adoration, and thanksgiving. I am filled with His joy, His peace, and His love. And as others see what God has done in me, many will come to trust and worship the Lord.</p>
            <h4 class="written_section_heading">God Wants Your Heart, Not Just Your Works</h4>
            <p>In verses 6-8 of Psalm 40, David reflects on something profound — that burnt offerings and religious rituals were not enough. God doesn’t just want our actions — He wants our hearts.</p>
            <p>Let’s read Hebrews 10:5–12, where Christ becomes the fulfillment of the Old Testament law.</p>
            <p class="written_scripture">Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, “Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body have you prepared for me; in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure. Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God, as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’” When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), then he added, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second. And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God. (Hebrews 10:5-12)</p>
            <p>Maybe you’ve been thinking, “Lord, look at all I’ve done — I taught Sunday school, fed the poor, I read and pray daily…” But I ask you: Are you doing these things to earn His approval, or are you offering your life as a loving response to His grace?</p>
            <p class="written_scripture">“He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?” (Micah 6:8).</p> 
            <p>No amount of religious activity can replace a heart of obedience and surrender. God delights when His Word is written on our hearts, when we love Him with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength.</p>
            <h4 class="written_section_heading">God Restores What Was Lost</h4>
            <p>The Lord didn't just lift me out of the pit — He restored what was lost. Listen to the promise of Joel 2:25-27:</p>
            <p class="written_scripture">"I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you. You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never again be put to shame. You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God and there is none else. And my people shall never again be put to shame." (Joel 2:25-27)</p> 
            <p>God restored me after 56 years of pain, and He has given me peace, purpose, and healing. And He can do the same for you. Nothing is too broken for God to redeem.</p>
            <p class="written_scripture">“Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them and reveal to them abundance of prosperity and security.” (Jeremiah 33:6)</p>
            <h4 class="written_section_heading">Proclaim What God Has Done</h4>
            <p>David says in Psalm 40:9–10:</p>
            <p class="written_scripture">"I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation; behold, I have not restrained my lips, as you know, O Lord. I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart; I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation; I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness from the great congregation." (Psalm 40:9-10)</p>
            <p>Church, we must proclaim what God has done — to the saved and unsaved alike. The world is desperate for hope. The harvest is ready. Let’s not hold back. Let’s shout it from the rooftops: Jesus saves!</p>
            <h4 class="written_section_heading">Final Words of Encouragement</h4>
            <p>Psalm 40 closes with humility:</p>
            <p class="written_scripture">“As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord takes thought for me. You are my help and my deliverer.” (Psalm 40:17)</p>
            <p>God has a plan for you.</p>
            <p class="written_scripture">“For I know the plans I have for you… plans to give you a future and a hope.” (Jeremiah 29:11)</p>
            <p>So I urge you: humble yourself before the Lord. Walk in obedience. Don’t let shame or past failures define you — you are a vessel of God’s glory. Let Him work mightily through you. Wait on the Lord — He will direct your path.</p>
            <p>Let’s go forward and proclaim the Good News of Jesus Christ — to a world bound by darkness, addiction, depression, confusion, and pain. There is healing. There is freedom. There is hope — in Jesus Christ alone.</p>
            <p>Amen.</p>
