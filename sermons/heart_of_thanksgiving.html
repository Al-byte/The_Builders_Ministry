          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Introduction</h4>
          <p>Today, I want to speak to you from a place that is deeply personal—a message not just of theology, but of transformation. A message not just of head knowledge, but of heart experience. This is the story of what happens when we stop living from the pain of the past and start living in the power of the resurrection. When we stop focusing on our failures and start focusing on the faithfulness of God. When we allow gratitude to shift our entire mindset. This is a message I’ve titled <strong>“A Heart of Thanksgiving.”</strong> Let’s begin by reading from Psalm 40:1–4:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“I waited patiently for the Lord; he turned to me and heard my cry. He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand. He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God.” (Psalm 40:1-4)</p>
          <p>Friends, that’s what our God does. He hears. He lifts. He restores. And He puts a new song—a song of thanksgiving—in our mouths.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Point 1: Deliverance Begins in the Mind</h4>
          <p>There was a time in my life when depression was my daily companion. For 53 years, I struggled with self-hatred and heaviness that words can hardly express. But God lifted me out of that pit. He didn’t just change my circumstances—He changed my thinking.</p>
          <p>Romans 12:2 says:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“Be transformed by the renewing of your mind.” (Romans 12:2)</p>
          <p>If you’ve given your life to Jesus, you are not who you used to be.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Point 2: Your Identity is Now Hidden in Christ</h4>
          <p>Colossians 3:1–4 says:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">"If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory." (Colossians 3:1-4)</p>
          <p>That means your identity is no longer shaped by depression, by addiction, by shame, or even by your successes. Your identity is in Jesus. You are hidden in Him. So Paul goes on to say: “Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature…”. Things like sexual immorality, impurity, anger, malice, and slander. Those things don’t define you anymore. You’ve taken off the old self—and you’ve put on the new.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Point 3: God is Not Finished with You Yet</h4>
          <p>Maybe you’re thinking, <i>“That all sounds great, but I still mess up.”</i> Let me encourage you with 1 John 2:1:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“If anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.” (1 John 2:1)</p>
          <p>You’re not expected to walk this road perfectly. When you fall, get back up. Repent. Receive His mercy. And walk forward again in grace. Don’t let Satan trap you in shame. The cross of Christ paid for your sin, past and future. There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Point 4: Thanksgiving is the Key to Transformation</h4>
          <p>Now here’s the turning point. Colossians 3:15–17 repeats this phrase again and again: Be thankful. Sing with gratitude. Do everything… giving thanks to God. Why? Because thankfulness rewires the heart. You can’t live in freedom and dwell in bitterness at the same time. You can’t walk in victory while nursing a mindset of defeat. You can’t experience the joy of salvation without cultivating a heart of thanksgiving. Gratitude turns your eyes upward. It breaks the power of depression, anxiety, fear, and anger. It may start small—just whispering “Thank You, Jesus” when you wake up. But that little act of gratitude grows. It becomes a habit. Then a mindset. Then a lifestyle. And eventually—a weapon of spiritual warfare.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Conclusion: A New Song in Your Mouth</h4>
          <p>Let’s go back to Psalm 40:3:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in him.”</p>
          <p>Did you catch that? When you live with a heart of thanksgiving, others are drawn to Jesus. They see the joy in your eyes. The peace in your steps. The grace in your words. Your life becomes a testimony that God still rescues. That He still restores. That He still puts new songs in broken hearts.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Call to Action</h4>
          <p>Today, I believe God is asking some of us to make a shift:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>From fear to faith.</li>
            <li>From shame to grace.</li>
            <li>From complaint to thanksgiving.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Maybe you’ve been focused on your failures or overwhelmed by your emotions. Maybe you’ve forgotten who you are in Christ. Maybe you’ve never really received that new identity at all. Wherever you are in your journey—God hears your cry. He’s turning to you. He’s lifting you out. And He’s putting a new song in your mouth. Will you sing it? Will you thank Him today? Will you renew your mind and remember who you are in Christ? </p>
