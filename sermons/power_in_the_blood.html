          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Introduction</h4>
          <p>Hello, Church. I come before you today as a representative of Midwest Bible College, where I have had the honor of being ordained and currently serve as Chairman of the Board. MBC is a unique Bible college that teaches only the Word of God—not denominational doctrine. We are dedicated to preparing men and women of all ages, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds to serve in local churches, communities, throughout the United States, and around the world.</p>
          <p>Over the years, we have worked with around 40 different churches, training pastors in the Milwaukee area, across the U.S., and in Africa. Since 2018, we’ve partnered with a ministry in Uganda and now train leaders in ten African nations. One of our affiliated ministries in Burundi has helped establish over 500 churches in the past 30 years. Our goal is not only to raise up pastors, but to empower all believers to grow in their knowledge of the Word and spread the Gospel everywhere.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Testimony</h4>
          <p>Let me begin with a personal testimony grounded in Psalm 40. Verse 2 says,</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">"He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings." (Psalm 40:2)</p>
          <p>That rock is Christ Jesus. He saved me from a pit of destruction, just as He’s able to do for anyone who calls on His name.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">There Is Power in the Blood</h4>
          <p>We all know the classic hymn:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Would you be free from the burden of sin? There’s power in the blood...</li>
            <li>There is power, power, wonder-working power in the precious blood of the Lamb.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This is more than a song. It is a declaration of truth: there is truly power in the blood of Jesus.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">The Life Is in the Blood</h4>
          <p class="written_scripture">“For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one’s life.” (Leviticus 17:11)</p>
          <p>In the Old Testament:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Blood sacrifices were required for the forgiveness of sin.</li>
            <li>Half the blood was sprinkled at the entrance of the tent of meeting, symbolizing the need to cleanse ourselves from the sin of the world—just as Jesus washed His disciples’ feet in John 13.</li>
            <li>The rest of the blood was used to sanctify the altar, and one goat—the scapegoat—was sent into the wilderness, carrying the sins of the people.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">The Passover and the Blood of the Lamb</h4>
          <p class="written_scripture">"Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat the lamb." (Exodus 12:7)</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">"The Lord said that on that night He would pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn, both people and animals, bringing judgment on all the gods of Egypt, for He is the Lord. But the blood on the houses where the Israelites were staying would be a sign; when the Lord saw the blood, He would pass over those homes, and no destructive plague would touch them when He struck Egypt." (Exodus 12:12-13)</p>
          <p>The Israelites were spared from judgment by applying the blood of a spotless lamb to their doorposts. That blood pointed forward to Jesus, the Lamb of God, whose blood brings forgiveness and eternal life. Hebrews 9:20–22 affirms, “Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.”</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">The Blood Covenant</h4>
          <p>Exodus 24:5–8 shows how blood sealed a covenant between God and His people. </p>
          <p class="written_scripture">"And he sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the Lord. And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he threw against the altar. Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people. And they said, 'All that the Lord has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.' And Moses took the blood and threw it on the people and said, 'Behold the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words'" (Exodus 24:5–8)</p>
          <p>Jesus fulfilled this in the New Covenant:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many." (Mark 14:24)</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">"...for the forgiveness of sins." (Matthew 26:28)</p>
          <p>We are not saved by living a good moral life or seeking man’s approval. We are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone. As the Charity Gayle song says:</p>
          <p><i>Thank You Jesus for the blood applied / Thank You Jesus, it has washed me white / You have saved my life / Brought me from the darkness into glorious light.</i></p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Jesus, Our Great High Priest </h4>
          <p class="written_scripture">"But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God. Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant" (Hebrews 9:11–15)</p>
          <p>Jesus entered the heavenly tabernacle—not with the blood of animals, but with His own blood—securing eternal redemption. Unlike the temporary cleansing of the Old Covenant, Jesus’ blood completely cleanses our conscience so that we may serve the living God. Romans 8:10–11 reminds us that the same Spirit who raised Christ from the dead lives in us. That means resurrection power is in us, too. Are you living in that power?</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Are You Living in the Power of the Blood?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Are you obeying God’s call on your life?</li>
            <li>Are you fulfilling the Great Commission?</li>
            <li>Are you just listening to sermons, or are you going out and sharing the Gospel?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Philippians 4:13 declares, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” The power in the blood enables us to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Proclaim the Gospel</li>
            <li>Heal broken lives</li>
            <li>Live holy and righteous before God</li>
            <li>Break chains of addiction, guilt, shame, and sin</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">A Call to Action</h4>
          <p>Wake up, Church! People are suffering. They are hurting. They are lost. But we have the hope of glory—Christ in us. If you have not yet surrendered your life to Jesus, come forward. Don’t leave without receiving the eternal gift of life. He wants to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Heal your soul</li>
            <li>Cleanse your conscience</li>    
            <li>Redeem your past</li>
            <li>Give you abundant and eternal life</li>
          </ul>
          <p>He loves you deeply and has already shed His blood for you. There is still power in the blood of the Lamb. <br> Amen.</p>
