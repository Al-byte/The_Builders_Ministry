          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Introduction</h4>
          <p>I am honored to come before you today representing Milwaukee Bible College, where I was ordained and now serve as Chairman of the Board. MBC is a unique institution—our only textbook is the Word of God. Our mission is simple yet profound: to train men and women of all ages, backgrounds, and nations for ministry—not just pastors, but anyone hungry to grow in the knowledge of God and spread the gospel in Milwaukee, across this nation, and to the ends of the earth. Each year, our student body includes believers from over 40 different churches. In 2018, we also established MBC Uganda, where pastors from eight African nations have been trained. Over the last 30 years, MBC has helped plant more than 500 churches around the world. We give all the glory to God.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Psalm 40:1–4 – A Personal Testimony</h4>
          <p class="written_scripture">I waited patiently for the Lord; he inclined to me and heard my cry. He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure. He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the Lord. Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust, who does not turn to the proud, to those who go astray after a lie." (Psalm 40:1-4)</p>
          <p>Beloved, do you love yourself? Can you truly say you grasp the depth of Jesus’ love for you? Matthew 19:19 tells us to “love your neighbor as yourself,” but how can you do that if you secretly despise or devalue who you are? For years, I wrestled with this question. I hated myself, and scriptures like that haunted me. How could I love others when I couldn’t love myself?</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Loving Yourself Means Renewing Your Mind</h4>
          <p>So how do we begin to love ourselves the way God intended?</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <strong>Think the way Jesus thinks about you.</strong>
              <p>That means renewing your mind. We must align our thoughts with the truth of Scripture—not emotion, not past wounds, and certainly not Satan’s lies.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Loving yourself isn’t arrogance—it’s humility.</strong>
              <p>It’s recognizing your humanity. God didn’t make a mistake when He created you. Yes, we are sinners saved by grace, but once redeemed, we are no longer identified by our sin. God sees us as saints through the blood of Jesus. You are now pure and holy in His sight.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Psalm 139:14 reminds us:</strong>
              <p class="written_scripture">“I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.”</p>
              <p>You are God’s masterpiece!</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Listen to the lyrics of “Dancing on the Waves” by We the Kingdom:</strong>
            <p>“I dare you to believe how much I love you... But you are my masterpiece, you are the reason I sing…”</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Zephaniah 3:17 tells us:</strong>
              <p>"The Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing." (Zephaniah 3:17)</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4 class="wirtten_section_heading">Reject the Lies of the Enemy</h4>
          <p>Satan is the accuser. He will whisper, “How can God forgive you?” or “Your sins are too great.” But the cross of Jesus Christ is greater than all our sins combined. Romans 5:18–21 explains how one man’s disobedience (Adam) brought condemnation, but one man’s obedience (Jesus) brought justification and life for all. Where sin increased, grace increased all the more. When you refuse to forgive yourself, you’re essentially saying Christ’s sacrifice wasn’t enough. That’s not humility—that’s unbelief. Romans 5:6–8 tells us:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die—but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:6-8)</p>
          <p>John 17:23 says that the Father loves us just as much as He loves Jesus. Let that sink in! And in Jeremiah 31:3, God declares:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have drawn you with lovingkindness.” (Jeremiah 31:3)</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Attitude Toward Yourself Is Key</h4>
          <p>Olympic medalist Scott Hamilton once said, “The only disability in life is a bad attitude.” Winston Churchill said, “Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.” So much of the battle is in our mindset. Romans 8:28 reminds us that “in all things God works for the good of those who love him.” Even in trials, we must discipline our emotions and minds to focus on God's goodness. God often uses our pain to help others. 2 Corinthians 1:3–4 tells us that He comforts us so we can comfort others.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Renewing the Mind Is Warfare</h4>
          <p><strong>2 Corinthians 10:4–5 </strong></p>
          <p class="written_scripture">For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ.</p>
          <p>You have resurrection power inside of you! 1 John 4:4 says,</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“Greater is He that is in you than he who is in the world.” (1 John 4:4)</p>
          <p>We are empowered by Christ to tear down every lie, every false belief, and every identity that does not come from God.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">A Call to Purity and Renewal in the Church</h4>
          <p>Ephesians 4:20–24 (AMP) urges us to put off our old selves and be “continually renewed in the spirit of your mind.” Church, we must wake up. Are we still walking in lust, pride, jealousy, and unforgiveness? Judgment begins in the house of the Lord. We are called to live lives of purity, righteousness, love, and holiness. Put on the new self—created in God’s image—and live in such a way that expresses your gratitude for salvation.</p>
          <h4 class="written_scripture">Conclusion: Stand in the Truth of Who You Are in Christ</h4>
          <p>Disregard every sinful, negative, unbiblical thought about yourself. Your true identity is found in Christ. You are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Righteous</li>
            <li>Holy</li>
            <li>Pure</li>
            <li>Justified</li>
            <li>Intensely and eternally loved</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So stand in these truths. Think them. Speak them. Live them. Live your life through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
