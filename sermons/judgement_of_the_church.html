          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Introduction</h4>
          <p>I come to you today not just as a minister of the gospel, but as a representative of Midwest Bible College, where I serve as the chairman of the board. Let me briefly tell you who we are. Midwest Bible College is a unique Bible college. We don’t teach denominational doctrine—we teach only the Word of God. Our mission is to train men and women of all ages, all races, and all backgrounds to prepare for ministry—whether that’s in the local church, the workplace, the community, or across the globe. In one year alone, we trained students from 43 different churches. In 2018, we affiliated with a Bible college in Uganda, which has now helped train pastors across eight African nations, resulting in the planting of 358 new churches in the last 30 years. We’ve trained pastors, elders, teachers, and laypeople—ordinary believers who want to do extraordinary things for God. My own testimony is found in Psalm 40:1–4, where David says:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“I waited patiently for the Lord; He turned to me and heard my cry. He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; He set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.” (Psalm 40:1-4)</p>
          <p>Friends, I believe God is calling His Church to rise from the mire—to be holy, bold, and ready. That brings me to today’s word: <strong>The Judgment of the Church</strong>.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">A House Divided Cannot Stand </h4>
          <p>In Luke 11:17-18, Jesus said:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.” (Luke 11:17-18)</p>
          <P>America is a house divided. Families are divided. Churches are divided. Our nation is splintering, and when division grows, the enemy takes ground. Satan isn’t confused—he is strategic. His kingdom is not divided. He’s launching a full-scale assault on everything godly:</P>
          <ul>
            <li>Christian doctrine</li>
            <li>Christian morality</li>
            <li>Christian identity</li>
            <li>and Christian churches.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">The Church is Under Attack </h4>
          <p>We are not imagining it. The war is real. Just look at recent history:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In 2020, 446 Catholic churches were attacked in the U.S.</li>
            <li>In 2023 alone, from January to November:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>436 acts of hostility were documented.</li>
                <li>That included 375 acts of vandalism, 75 arsons, 10 gun-related attacks, 20 bomb threats, and 37 other criminal incidents.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>From 2018–2023, the total acts of hostility were 915—and that’s just what was reported.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>But it’s not just buildings—it’s beliefs that are under siege. Those in authority—whether in government, media, or education—are lifting up sin over righteousness. They mock the Ten Commandments. They redefine truth, and replace God's Word with lies.</p>
          <p>Listen to what the Bible says:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials become wicked.” (Proverbs 29:12)</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“No one calls for justice; no one pleads a case with integrity… they conceive trouble and give birth to evil.” (Isaiah 59:4)</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“Destructive forces are at work in the city; threats and lies never leave its streets.” (Psalm 55:11)</p>
          <p>That sounds like Chicago. That sounds like New York. That sounds like Milwaukee. It sounds like America.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">The World is Celebrating Rebellion</h4>
          <p>Our culture has become proud of what it once blushed at:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Homosexuality and transgender ideology are celebrated.</li>
            <li>Sex outside of marriage is normalized.</li>
            <li>Marriage is being redefined—and God’s design is dismissed.</li>
            <li>Violence, racism, and hatred of authority are being stirred up.</li>
            <li>Riots are excused, and law enforcement is demonized.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And if you speak the truth—you’re labeled hateful. But Church, truth is not hate speech. Truth is what sets people free.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Judgement Begins in God's House</h4>
          <p>1 Peter 4:17 says:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“For it is time for judgment to begin with God’s household.” (1 Peter 4:17)</p>
          <p>Before God judges the world, He purifies the Church.</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“I will pour out my wrath on you… I will deliver you into the hands of brutal men… You will be fuel for the fire… You will be remembered no more; for I the Lord have spoken.” (Ezekiel 21:31-32)</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“I tried to cleanse you, but you would not be cleansed… You will be judged according to your conduct and your actions.” (Ezekiel 24:13–14:)</p>
          <p>This is not a time for comfort—this is a time for consecration.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">We Must Put On the Armor of God</h4>
          <p>It’s time to stop being passive Christians. You weren’t saved to sit—you were saved to stand.</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“Put on the full armor of God… so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground.” (Ephesians 6:10–13)</p>
          <p>You are not wrestling with people—you are wrestling with spiritual forces of darkness. Satan is working through systems, media, leaders, and institutions. But God has equipped you with heavenly weapons.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Stop Warming Seats—Start Waging War</h4>
          <p class="written_scipture">“Though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does… We take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.” (2 Corinthians 10:3-6)</p>
          <p>We are called to speak truth, live in righteousness, stand in faith, and fight for souls. No more lukewarm Christianity. No more silence.</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Prepare for Revival and Persecution</h4>
          <p>Ezekiel 28:18–19 speaks of judgment to a nation corrupted by sin:</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“By your many sins… you have desecrated your sanctuaries… I reduced you to ashes on the ground… you will come to a horrible end and will be no more.” (Ezekiel 28:18-19)</p>
          <p>Friends, we don’t know when judgment will fall, but it is coming. So we must:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Be rooted and grounded in God’s Word.</li>
            <li>Be ready to proclaim the Gospel with boldness.</li>
            <li>Pray for a mighty revival—because the laborers are few.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Conclusion: Are You Ready?</h4>
          <p>Are you ready to stand? <br>Are you ready to be the light in the darkness? <br>Are you ready to be counted among the righteous remnant? <br><br>The time is short. The days are evil. But God has not called us to fear—He’s called us to fight.</p>
          <p class="written_scripture">“Awake, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.” (Ephesians 5:14)</p>
          <h4 class="written_section_heading">Altar Call / Final Challenge</h4>
          <p>If you’ve been compromising, it’s time to repent. <br> If you’ve been asleep, it’s time to awaken. <br>If you’ve been afraid, it’s time to rise in boldness. <br>Let the Church arise—holy, purified, and ready for the return of our King. <br>Amen.</p>
