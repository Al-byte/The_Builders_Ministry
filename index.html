              <p>Thank you for this opportunity to introduce The Builders Ministry. We are a 501(c)3 nonprofit ministry founded by Reverend Roger S. Smith of Milwaukee, WI. Our mission is to awaken the sleeping Church and ignite the faith of Christian believers, that they might lead a great Christian revival that grows out of small communities to sweep across the world.</p>
              <p>People everywhere are facing different challenges. Despite being a man of faith with a loving family, for more than fifty years, Reverend Smith struggled greatly against depression that brought darkness into his heart. In 2023, our Lord healed Reverend Smith from that sickness and called him back to ministry, to fulfill His will and begin awakening His Church.</p>
              <p>Reverend Smith is crafting a series of sermon messages that draw on the Lord’s teaching and the revealed wisdom that healed him from depression. This sermon series is the foundation that we hope to firmly establish and spread to new congregations, through a combination of guest preaching and online outreach through our ministry website.</p>
              <p>The Builders Ministry teaches Christians and equips them with the fullness of Christ’s Gospel, to free them from bondage in their lives, and show them the path to repentance and humility. By understanding that they are forgiven for their sins, and embracing their full authority in Jesus, Christian believers become living actions of God that spread His Gospel.</p>
              <p>Right now, we are taking the first, tiny steps of a very long journey. Thank you for your prayers, your support, and for sharing in our mission to awaken Christ’s Church.</p>
              <p>Your friend in Christ, <br><br>Rev. Roger S. Smith <br>Founder <br>The Builders Ministry</p>

        <h2 class="index_info_title text-center">What We Believe</h2>
        <p> Our ministry is built upon the belief that we are all called to The Great Commission
            and what the prophet Isaiah said in Isaiah 61:1–3:
            "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, 
            Because the Lord has anointed and commissioned me
            To bring good news to the humble and afflicted;
            He has sent me to bind up [the wounds of] the brokenhearted,
            To proclaim release [from confinement and condemnation] to the [physical and spiritual] captives
            And freedom to prisoners, To proclaim the favorable year of the Lord,
            And the day of vengeance and retribution of our God,
            To comfort all who mourn,
            To grant to those who mourn in Zion the following:
            To give them a turban instead of dust [on their heads, a sign of mourning],
            The oil of joy instead of mourning,
            The garment [expressive] of praise instead of a disheartened spirit.
            So they will be called the trees of righteousness [strong and magnificent, distinguished for integrity, justice, and right standing with God],
            The planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified."</p>

        <h2 class="index_info_title">Authority of Scripture</h2>
        <p>We believe that the Bible is the infallible word of God. “All Scripture is God 
          breathed and is used for teaching, rebuking, correcting, training in 
          righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for 
          every good work.” 2 Tim. 3:16-17 The Bible is the truth. “For prophecy 
          never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke 
          from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.”  
          2 Pet. 1:21. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-12 my-3">
        <h2 class="index_info_title">Nature of God</h2>
        <p>We believe in the Holy Trinity: God the Father, Jesus the Son and the Holy 
          Spirit. Jesus was born of a virgin birth by the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus 
          lived on earth and was fully man and fully God. He bore our sins on the 
          cross and was resurrected on the third day. He is alive! Jesus Christ is our 
          salvation, the only way into the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-12 my-3">
        <h2 class="index_info_title">Path of Salvation</h2>
        <p>We are saved only by God’s grace through our faith in Jesus Christ. “For it 
          is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this is not from 
          yourself, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast.” 
          Eph. 2:8-9</p>
