            Christ to walk in the light of the Lord, to overcome depression, and inspire both their churches and fellow
            Christians, that their faith may ignite the fire that fulfills the Great Commission in accordance with Matt.

            States. The Church is asleep, and must wake up. A fire must be set beneath Christians to ignite their faith and
            raise them up in Christ. To revive and nourish the Church, Christians must purify themselves and become
            holy, righteous, compassionate, empathetic, joyful vessels of Christ’s love and radiant light. They must
            embrace the full gospel so that God’s Word may spread.</p>

            <p>Roger Smith is a born again Christian and ordained minister. After decades as a worship leader as well 
              as a Bible student and teacher, he is a seasoned preacher, and brings experience from both the 
              professional marketing industry as well as public and private philanthropy. Recently healed from a long 
              depression, Roger has been infused with the Holy Spirit and given the vision of a ministry that can wake 
              up the Church, beginning in small communities and spreading throughout the nations.  
             </p> 
             <p>In 1977, at age 26, Roger became a born again believer in Jesus Christ, and was baptized in the Holy 
              Spirit. Two years later, he left his role as a counselor at The 700 Club’s office in Milwaukee, WI, to attend 
              the Shiloh Training Institute and was licensed as a reverend. In 1982, he travelled to Nigeria on an 
              evangelistic mission before entering full-time ministry, traveling and preaching to different groups, which 
              also included further international mission work in Jamaica.  
              </p>
              <p>In 1985, Roger joined the family business at A.O. Smith Corporation. Over a 32-year career, he worked in 
              marketing, was a federal lobbyist, and spent nearly a decade managing the company’s nonprofit A.O. 
              Smith Foundation, while leading public relations in the Milwaukee community. During his professional 
              career, Roger also served on the boards of several nonprofit organizations in Wisconsin, including the 
              Wisconsin Policy Forum, the Wisconsin Council on Economic Education, and the Milwaukee Art Museum.  
              </p>
              <p>Roger retired from full-time work in 2018 but maintains his own business as an artist selling watercolor 
              landscapes. He has served for seven years on the board at Midwest Bible College, currently as 
              Chairman, where he also teaches. He also serves on the Board of Directors at A.O. Smith Foundation as 
              well as Discovery World, and the Zoological Society of Milwaukee. Roger is also a Bible teacher for the 
              Faithwalker Men’s Bible Study Group in Milwaukee.  
              </p>
              <p>Roger and his wife Judy are members and worship leaders at Eastbrook church, where they have served 
              for more than 20 years, and have also led worship at various retreats. They also served at St. James 
              Catholic Church’s Charismatic Prayer Group for more than 10 years, and additionally attend Spanish 
              River Church in Boca Raton, FL.  
              </p>
              <p>In 2023, the Lord called Roger back into full-time ministry, to wake up the Church. After struggling with 
              depression for 53 years, he was healed through Christ and given deep revelations and insight into his 
              faith. This experience has lit a fire beneath him, and that spark has grown into this vision of The Builders 
              Ministry.</p>
